          <h2>UCOL Palmerston North</h2>
          I started my journey as a tech student in 2022 at UCOL, where I had to
          adapt to a new environment. With minimal knowledge in tech, I knew I
          had to change, so I started grinding C# at home to impress my peers.
          <br /> Outcome: Certificate acquired, peers impressed, parents...
          still disappointed I didnâ€™t become a doctor.

          with peers on real-world applications, solidifying my passion for the
